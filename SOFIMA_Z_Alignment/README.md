# Z-Alignment with SOFIMA

A tool to perform fine z-axis alignment using SOFIMA. To account for alignment with multiple layers, a procedure known as vector voting is used, as described in (). 

TODO: The developers of SOFIMA recently published their own z-alignment pipeline, described in [https://github.com/google-research/sofima/blob/main/notebooks/em_alignment.ipynb](https://github.com/google-research/sofima/blob/main/notebooks/em_alignment.ipynb). I still need to experiment with this pipeline.
