# SATORI
Stitching and Alignment Tools for High Resolution Images

## Overview of Algorithm

## TODO

- Write a tutorial notebook and clean the code (the one published is just how I tested the code)
- Add before and after examples of alignment (in the meantime, feel free to look at [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SUviw5sUwAw1XwslRTyoXkU8T08bSQFH?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SUviw5sUwAw1XwslRTyoXkU8T08bSQFH?usp=sharing))
- Parallelize and JIT code using [numba](https://numba.pydata.org/)
- Add ability to re-optimize, while fixing some meshes
- Remove SOFIMA dependency in the matching point calculations
